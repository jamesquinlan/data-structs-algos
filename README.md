# Data Structures and Algorithms DSC270

## Course Description

The practical goal of the course is to write more efficient programs. To that end, the course presents a broad array of algorithms -- methods for solving problems suited for computer implementation.  In addition to algorithms, our study will include data structures -- schemes for organizing data that allow efficient processing by an algorithm.  Students learn to implement and analyze elementary data structures and algorithms that use greedy, divide-and-conquer, and backtracking.  Computer problems of searching, sorting, and selecting are practical applications of these techniques.


## Learning Outcomes

At the conclusion of this course students will be able to:

	1  Plan, design, write, and comment Python code;

	1  Describe, explain, and use various data structures including arrays, stacks, queues, 
	lists, and trees in algorithms;

	1  Analyze the time and space efficiency of data structures and algorithms 
	and apply this analysis to select  optimal techniques to a particular problem.


	1  Read and write recursive algorithms. Understand  when to appropriately 
	use recursion;
